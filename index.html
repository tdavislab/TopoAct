        <h3>Introduction</h3>

            Deep neural networks such as GoogLeNet and ResNet have achieved superhuman performance in tasks like image
            classification.
            To understand how such superior performance is achieved, we can probe a trained deep neural network by
            studying
            neuron activations, that is, combinations of neuron firings, at any layer of the network in response to a
            particular
            input.
            With a large set of input images, we aim to obtain a global view of what neurons detect by studying their
            activations.
            We ask the following questions: What is the shape of the activation space?
            That is, what is the organizational principle behind neuron activations, and how are the activations related
            within
            a layer and across layers?
            Using tools from topological data analysis, we present <b>TopoAct</b>, a visual exploration system used to
            study
            topological summaries of activation vectors for a single layer as well as the evolution of such summaries
            across
            multiple layers.
            We present visual exploration scenarios using <b>TopoAct</b> that provide valuable insights towards learned
            representations of an image classifier.
